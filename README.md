# Hybrid_Image
The high frequency of an image gives us the edges of that image, and the low frequency is more like the form of it (Kind of the blur image, without the edges). Together they, of course, provides the whole image.

If you filter (Using a gaussian blur filter) the high frequency of an image and the lower frequency of the other, you can do a sum of them to create a image the has the edges of one and the blur of the other. Looking from near, you can see the edges, lookin for 1m, you can see the blur.

The code picks two images names and show a single image of those two images with this propriaties
